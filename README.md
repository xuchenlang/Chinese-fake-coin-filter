1. Train the Model:
- Train the image classification model in Python using TensorFlow or Keras (as outlined previously).
- Save the model in a format accessible by TensorFlow Serving or ONNX.

2. Set Up TensorFlow Serving:
- Deploy the trained model using TensorFlow Serving as a REST API endpoint.

3. Write Go Code:
- Use the Go programming language to send requests to the TensorFlow Serving API for predictions.
- Handle image preprocessing, model inference, and response interpretation in Go.
